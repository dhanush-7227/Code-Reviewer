Okay, I've reviewed the JavaScript code snippet you provided:

```javascript
function sum () {return a+b}
```

Here's my analysis and suggestions:

**Issues:**

1.  **Missing Parameters:** The function `sum` is intended to add two numbers, but it doesn't define any parameters (`a` and `b`) to receive those numbers.  This means the function will rely on variables `a` and `b` existing in the scope where the function is called (likely the global scope), which is bad practice and can lead to unpredictable behavior.
2.  **Undeclared Variables:**  If `a` and `b` are not defined in the scope where `sum` is called, the function will attempt to access undeclared variables. In non-strict mode, this will implicitly create global variables `a` and `b`, which is generally undesirable. In strict mode, it will throw a `ReferenceError`.

**Why these issues are problematic:**

*   **Scope Pollution:** Relying on global variables makes your code harder to reason about and maintain. It increases the risk of naming conflicts and unintended side effects.
*   **Unpredictable Behavior:**  The function's behavior depends on the state of the global scope, which can change unpredictably.
*   **Error Prone:**  If `a` or `b` are not numbers (or cannot be coerced into numbers), the `+` operator might perform string concatenation instead of addition, leading to unexpected results.

**Suggested Edits:**

The best approach is to define parameters for the `sum` function, so it explicitly receives the values it needs to work with:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Explanation of the Edits:**

*   **`function sum(a, b)`:** This defines the function `sum` with two parameters: `a` and `b`.  These parameters act as local variables within the function's scope.
*   **`return a + b;`:**  This line performs the addition of the `a` and `b` parameters and returns the result.

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
let result = sum(5, 3); // result will be 8
console.log(result);
```

This revised code is much cleaner, more predictable, and follows best practices for JavaScript function design. It avoids reliance on global variables and clearly defines the inputs required for the function to operate correctly.
